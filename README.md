# Jeffco_retail_sales

I'm currently learning how to work with Matplotlib's object oriented interface (OOI).  

I downloaded Colorado's Retail Reports by County (link below), isolated Jefferson County (commonly referred to as Jeffco) and graphed their retail sales over the past 6 years.  2021 only included January - August sales numbers, so I made it a stacked bar chart so the reader could visually estimate what the full year's retail revenues would look like.
